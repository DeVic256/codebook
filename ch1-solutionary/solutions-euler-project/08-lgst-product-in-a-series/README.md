## Solution

The approach is to multiply all sequences of size $13$ in the input above.

This is an example of a 

|Sequence #|13-Sequence  |Product  |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:-------:|
|1         |7316717653133|5000940  |
|2         |3167176531330|0        |
|3         |1671765313306|0        |
|4         |6717653133062|0        |

### Oops ðŸ˜±

As you can notice the last 3 sequences return zero since they have a $0$ included multiplying the whole sequence. 

Not only that but if I continue with this approach, I will be multiplying $13$ entire sequences for each $0$ which we can get rid of.

First, I take the zeroes out with a `split(0)`, that will give me a vector of sequences which do not contain any zeroes at all.

Solving that, next step is to get rid of sequences of less then $13$ numbers, due to these not being a requirement for me to process.

So I continue to `filter` by size all sequences and only then, process remaining sub-sequences to get the highest products as I would have done

in the beggining, but they are just in a different format. Notice I can't join them back together since the splitted sequences are no longer contiguous.

Here's how it would go:

```ruby
# This is for sure a seq with 13 or more numbers
def higher(seq)
  lw, up = 0, 12
  prod, higher = 1, 1

  while up < seq.length
      prod = seq[lw..up].product
      higher = prod if prod > higher
  end

  higher
end

# Main fn
def find_highest_product(input)
  input.split('0')
       .filter( |subseq| { subseq.length >= 13 } )
       .map(&:higher).max # Getting the max out of the largest subseq products
end
```
